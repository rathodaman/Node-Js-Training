What is PM2?
-PM2 is an acronym of Process Management Module which is used to run and manage Node.js applications.
-It's an open-source with an in-built load balancer.
-When a process goes down, PM2 will automatically restart the service and make it Live.
-PM2 works on Linux, Windows, and macOS.
-We can enable the process to automatically start on system boot up or while restart.
-Without the need of changing the application code, we can scale the applications or processes for High Availability.
